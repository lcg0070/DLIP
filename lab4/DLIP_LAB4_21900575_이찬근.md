## Procedure

**Installation**

1. Install PyTorch(Writer used the mac version of Pytorch 2.0.0)

```python
#window
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
#mac
pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

**Choose model**

yolov5 model is good enough to detect car in parking lot

There are various types of models in yolov5 and there are s, m, l, x, etc. depending on the size

1. yolov5s, yolov5m model
    
    ![https://github.com/lcg0070/DLIP/blob/main/lab4/image/s.png?raw=true](https://github.com/lcg0070/DLIP/blob/main/lab4/image/s.png?raw=true)
    
    ![https://github.com/lcg0070/DLIP/blob/main/lab4/image/s_result.png?raw=true](https://github.com/lcg0070/DLIP/blob/main/lab4/image/s_result.png?raw=true)
    
    As shown from the picture, the accuracy decreases when using a small model. It is detected not only by car but also by bus and truck for the same object, causing data confusion. In addition, there were cases where cars were detected in empty spaces without cars.
    
2. yolov5l, yolov5x
    
    ![https://github.com/lcg0070/DLIP/blob/main/lab4/image/x.png?raw=true](https://github.com/lcg0070/DLIP/blob/main/lab4/image/x.png?raw=true)
    
    ![https://github.com/lcg0070/DLIP/blob/main/lab4/image/x_result.png?raw=true](https://github.com/lcg0070/DLIP/blob/main/lab4/image/x_result.png?raw=true)
    
    As shown from the picture, the large model such as the x model, the accuracy is high. It can be seen that stable data can be obtained because it is detected only by car, not bus or truck, and does not cause data confusion
    

Therefore, the most accurate x model was determined

**Counting Algorithm**

The center x coordinates of the parking lot location in the image are around [80, 180, 280, 390, 480, 580, 690, 780, 880, 970, 1060, 1170, 1230] and y coorinates is 720/2 + 50, which is 410

```python
park = [80, 180, 280, 390, 480, 580, 690, 780, 880, 970, 1060, 1170, 1230]
```

Therefore, the logic was written with the detected coordinates of x1, y1, x2, and y2.

1. If the parking lot’s x coordinate exists between the x1,x2 coordinates of the object detected as car and the average of (y1, y2) coordinate is less than the parking lot y-coordinate, determine that the car is occupied
    
    Also, the confidence variable was changed to 0.17, not 0.5 which is default. To detect all objects classified as cars as much as possible. 
    
    (This was also possible by using a large model called yolov5x)
    

```python
for result in results.pandas().xyxy[0].iterrows():
                if (result[1]['name'] in ('car')) and result[1]['confidence'] > 0.17:
                    #0.35, # 0.3, #0.25
                    x1, y1, x2, y2 = int(result[1]['xmin']), int(result[1]['ymin']), int(result[1]['xmax']), int(result[1]['ymax'])
                    if((y1+y2)/2 < height/2+50):
                        cv.rectangle(frame, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (0, 255, 0), 2) 
                        for i in range(PARK_LEN):
                            if x1<park[i]<x2:
                                state_list[i] = 1
```

1. A state_list with a length of 13 according to the condition of each parking lot was declared to determine how many parking lots there were

```python
state_list = [0 for _ in range(PARK_LEN)]
```

Also made function find_indexes to find the location of the not occupied parking lot

```python
def find_indexes(lst, value):
    indexes = []
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if lst[i] == value:
            indexes.append(i+1)
    return indexes
```

The state_list is in this form

state_list = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]

(1 is occupied and 0 is not)

**Output**

Finally, the number of frames, the number of parked cars, and the location that is not parked are all printed out Outputs the number of frames and the number of parked cars in a text file

1. txt file
    
    Declared function save_to_txt to make easy to save txt file
    
    ```python
    def save_to_txt(data):
        with open('output.txt', 'a') as file:
            file.write(data + '\n')
    
    frame_with_number = f"{frame_count} {sum(state_list)}"
    save_to_txt(frame_with_number)
    ```
    
2. putText
    
    Wrote the code more simply using state_list.
    
    ```python
    cv.putText(frame,"Frame : "+ f"{frame_count}",(30,50),cv.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX,1.2,(255,0,255),2)
    cv.putText(frame,"Number of cars : "+ f"{sum(state_list)}",(30,80),cv.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX,1.2,(255,0,255),2)
    cv.putText(frame,"Blank space : " + f"{find_indexes(state_list,0)}",(30,110),cv.FONT_HERSHEY_SIMPLEX,1.2,(255,0,255),2)
    ```
    

## **Results and Analysis**

Finally, in the output txt file, the number of frames at the point where the number of cars changes was intensively checked. Other than that, it was checked whether the number of cars changes in a continuous order by frame at time, or whether the number of cars has oscillation, because of not properly detected in the model.

So, it was found that the result of the actual image and the judgment ability of the actual frame were very similar.

But, in 252~255, 277 frames 12 was the expected value, but 11 was printed.

So the accuracy is (2500-5)/2500, which is 99.8%

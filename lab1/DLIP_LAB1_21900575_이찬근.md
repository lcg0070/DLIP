# Introduction

### Objective

Count the various nuts and bolts in the gray scale image by size and shape

**Goal**: There are two different size bolts and three different types of nuts. You are required to segment the object and count each part of

- Bolt M5
- Bolt M6
- Square Nut M5
- Hex Nut M6
- Hex Nut M5

# Preparation

**Software Installation**

- OpenCV 3.4.2, Visual Studio Code 1.76.2

**Dataset**

Gray_scale image of Nuts and Bolts

## Procedure

1. Pre-Processing
    - The bolts and nuts in the black and white picture should be distinguished according to size and shape. A preprocessing process using threshold is necessary. To get a new image with only the parts of components.
        
        (But, when simply inserting the threshold value, it was judged that many noises occurred and the desired result value could not be obtained, so it was thought that pretreatment such as blur was necessary)
        
        ![https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeeChanKeun/DLIP/main/lab1/Image/Threshold_ex.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LeeChanKeun/DLIP/main/lab1/Image/Threshold_ex.png)
        
2. Filtering
    - Therefore, after using the Gaussian blur to maintain the shape of the original nuts and bolts as much as possible during the blur method,
    morphology_open was used to reduce salt and pepper noise.
        
        ![https://github.com/LeeChanKeun/DLIP/blob/main/lab1/Image/Blur_Morph.png?raw=true](https://github.com/LeeChanKeun/DLIP/blob/main/lab1/Image/Blur_Morph.png?raw=true)
        
    - Components in processed image are generally high in brightness. Itâ€™s the reason that we can use the threshold method to obtain a clearer image
        
        (Threshold value was set with 125. This is because the high value, gets the cleaner the image, but if the value is too high, the hex nut M5 on the lower left and other parts are not accurately measured)

3. Contour
    - Measure and draw only the contour that meets the minimum area(>500)
    - In the case of nuts, if the outer line is not greatly distorted, it can be seen that a small hole exists. In particular, it can be seen that the rect nut maintains a 4 right angles
        
        ```cpp
        if (vertices==4){//rect nut
        						if (area > 3500 && area < 4700){
        							c = Scalar(100,255,200);
        							num_four_nuts++;
        							}
        }else if(perimeter<350){//hex nut
        						if(area>1500 && area<4000){//m6 and m5
        							c = Scalar(200,100,255);
        							num_six_nuts2++;
        						}else if(area>4000){
        							c = Scalar(100,200,255);
        							num_six_nuts1++;
        						}
        }
        ```
        
    - In the case of bolts, the size and width are very large compared to nuts, so they can be distinguished through the area and length of the contour
        
        ```cpp
        if(perimeter>550){
        						c = Scalar(0,255,0);
        						num_bolt1++;
        }else if(perimeter>400){
        						c = Scalar(255,100,0);
        						num_bolt2++;
        }
        ```
        
    - In the processed image, there are four-angle nuts with two attached. Therefore, check how many nuts or bolts are attached through the number of inherited holes or area, and further classify the cases where two are attached according to each condition.(Vertices, Area)
        
        ```cpp
        int rec=vertices%(4*count); //rect nut attached
        
        int hex=vertices%(6*count); //hex nut attached
        
        if(rec==0 || rec==1){
        						c = Scalar(100,255,200);
        						num_four_nuts+=2;
        }else if(hex==0 || hex==1){//area m5 hexnut:4000, m6 hexnut: 5500
        						if(area>11000){
        								c = Scalar(200,100,255);
        								num_six_nuts2+=2;
        						}else if(area>9000){
        								c = Scalar(150,150,255);
        								num_six_nuts1++;
        								num_six_nuts2++;
        						}else if(area>7000){
        								c = Scalar(100,200,255);
        								num_six_nuts1+=2;
        						}
        }
        ```
        
    - According to each situation above, the scalar value was adjusted to change the color of the contour and express it separately.
        
        ```cpp
        drawContours(output, a, -1, c, 2);
        ```
        

1. Print Result
    - As in the above code, the number of parts was counted by assigning not only scalars but also each count variable

# Result and Discussion

## 1. Final Result

As shown in the picture below, it can be seen that each component is divided into different colors, and the number is counted and output normally.

## 2. Discussion

As shown in the example picture, the classification was completed according to the type of each part, and the number of counts for each part was also normally performed, so the experiment can be said to be successful

# Conclusion

This lab distinguishes bolts and nuts of different sizes and types, displays them on the picture, and outputs the number.

The most difficult part of this experiment was to distinguish between two attached nuts.

Adjusting the threshold value only to distinguish the nut will distort the shape of the hexagonal nut in the lower left, so it will be easier to solve the problem if blur and morph are used properly together.
